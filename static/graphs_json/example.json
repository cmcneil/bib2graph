While previously cultivated mostly in monastic settings, a series of modern meditation manuals both openly discuss the jh\u0101nas and describe how they may be attained by laypeople. Simultaneously, the phenomenological and neuroscientific investigation of the jh\u0101nas is advancing. Although the descriptions of the jh\u0101nas in contemporary jh\u0101na manuals to some degree overlap with one another, there are also significant disagreements. Here our objectives are to identify common features of jh\u0101na in meditation manuals, to identify and discuss disagreements, and to offer an account of jh\u0101na that is both comprehensive and consistent. Methods A literature search and review was conducted. The search resulted in eight meditation manuals that provide phenomenologically rich accounts of the full range of the jh\u0101nas. Common characteristics and discrepancies in the different accounts of the jh\u0101nas have been identified by comparing terms and descriptions. Results We offer a general definition of jh\u0101na, distinguish three types of jh\u0101na, and investigate phenomenological dimensions that may be necessary to address in order to comprehensively articulate the experience of ACAM. Conclusions To ensure scientific rigor, the study of jh\u0101na needs to be informed by both commonalities and differences in the existing accounts of jh\u0101na. While differences exist, these may also be systematically unified in a way that yields a comprehensive account of ACAM."}, {"id": "7bab004c581f864c4526e1ad79f5538822b0bbbc", "title": "Intensive whole-brain 7T MRI case study of volitional control of brain activity in deep absorptive meditation states.", "citationCount": 5, "year": 2023, "size": 102.02702702702703, "color": "#f8df25", "shortName": "Yang2024-kw", "doi": "10.1093/cercor/bhad408", "authors": ["Winson, Yang", "Avijit, Chowdhury", "Marta, Bianciardi", "Remko, Lutterveld", "Terje, Sparby", "Matthew, Sacchet"], "abstract": "Jhanas are profound states of mind achieved through advanced meditation, offering valuable insights into the nature of consciousness and tools to enhance well-being.

Increasing evidence shows a wide range of experiences that can arise with regular mindfulness meditation, from profoundly positive to challenging and potentially harmful. Initial research suggests that complex interactions and temporal sequences may explain these experiential phenomena and their relations to health and well-being. We believe further study of the effects of mindfulness meditation is urgently needed to better understand the benefits and challenges of continued practice after initial instructions.

The fMRI and EEG results from an experienced meditator show changes in brain activity in 11 regions shown to be associated with the subjective reports, and these changes occur promptly after jhana is entered.

Mapping the neurobiological substrates of jhana meditation can inform the development and application of advanced meditation to enhance well-being. Only two prior studies have attempted to investigate the neural correlates of jhana meditation, and the rarity of adept practitioners has largely restricted the size and extent of these studies. Therefore, examining the consistency and reliability of observed brain responses associated with jhana meditation can be valuable. In this study, we aimed to characterize functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reliability within a single subject over repeated runs in canonical brain networks during jhana meditation performed by an adept practitioner over 5 days (27 fMRI runs) inside an ultra-high field 7 Tesla MRI scanner. We found that thalamus and several cortical networks, that is, the somatomotor, limbic, default-mode, control, and temporo-parietal, demonstrated good within-subject reliability across all jhanas. Additionally, we found that several other relevant brain networks (e.g., attention, salience) showed noticeable increases in reliability when fMRI measurements were adjusted for variability in self-reported phenomenology related to jhana meditation.

In association cortex, the connectivity patterns often showed abrupt transitions between network boundaries. Focused analyses were performed to better understand properties of network connectivity. A canonical sensory-motor pathway involving primary visual area, putative middle temporal area complex (MT+), lateral intraparietal area, and frontal eye field was analyzed to explore how interactions might arise within and between networks. Results showed that adjacent regions of the MT+ complex demonstrate differential connectivity consistent with a hierarchical pathway that spans networks. The functional connectivity of parietal and prefrontal association cortices was next explored.

Detailed high-resolution analyses of single individuals suggest that the default network is not a single network, as historically described, but instead comprises multiple interwoven networks. The multiple networks share a common organizational motif (also evident in marmoset and macaque anatomical circuits) that might support a general class of processing function dependent on internally constructed rather than externally constrained representations, with each separate interwoven network specialized for a distinct processing domain. Direct neuronal recordings in humans and monkeys reveal evidence for competitive relationships between the internally and externally oriented networks. Findings from rodent studies suggest that the thalamus might be essential to controlling which networks are engaged through specialized thalamic reticular neurons, including antagonistic subpopulations.

In contrast to a focused attention task the TE task showed significant central and parietal gamma decreases (p < 0.05). Compared to open monitoring TE expressed decreased alpha and beta amplitudes, mainly in parietal areas (p < 0.01). TE presented significantly less delta (p < 0.001) and theta (p < 0.05) waves than a wakeful closed eyes resting condition. A group of participants with none or little meditation practice did not present those differences significantly. Our findings indicate that a conscious state of TE reached by experienced meditators is characterized by reduced high-frequency brain processing with simultaneous reduction of the low frequencies. This suggests that such a state of meditative conscious awareness might be different from higher cognitive and mentally focused states but also from states of sleep and drowsiness."}, {"id": "23f71fc1f5ec04f0196cff2ea8a561a0e9240cad", "title": "Toward a unifying taxonomy and definition for meditation", "citationCount": 153, "year": 2013, "size": 162.02702702702703, "color": "#9511a1", "shortName": "Nash2013-of", "doi": "10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00806", "authors": ["Jonathan, Nash", "A, Newberg", "Bhuvanesh, Awasthi"], "abstract": "One of the well-documented concerns confronting scholarly discourse about meditation is the plethora of semantic constructs and the lack of a unified definition and taxonomy. In recent years there have been several notable attempts to formulate new lexicons in order to define and categorize meditation methods. While these constructs have been useful and have encountered varying degrees of acceptance, they have also been subject to misinterpretation and debate, leaving the field devoid of a consensual paradigm. This paper attempts to influence this ongoing discussion by proposing two new models which hold the potential for enhanced scientific reliability and acceptance. Regarding the quest for a universally acceptable taxonomy, we suggest a paradigm shift away from the norm of fabricatIng new terminology from a first-person perspective. As an alternative, we propose a new taxonomic system based on the historically well-established and commonly accepted third-person paradigm of Affect and Cognition, borrowed, in part, from the psychological and cognitive sciences. With regard to the elusive definitional problem, we propose a model of meditation which clearly distinguishes \u201cmethod\u201d from \u201cstate\u201d and is conceptualized as a dynamic process which is inclusive of six related but distinct stages. The overall goal is to provide researchers with a reliable nomenclature with which to categorize and classify diverse meditation methods, and a conceptual framework which can provide direction for their research and a theoretical basis for their findings."}, {"id": "b613d6001efd2b1a32a1496d6b64f4b14e85fc8d", "title": "Reduced functional connectivity between cortical sources in five meditation traditions detected with lagged coherence using EEG tomography", "citationCount": 132, "year": 2012, "size": 153.51351351351352, "color": "#7e03a8", "shortName": "Lehmann2012-pn", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.01.042", "authors": ["D, Lehmann", "P, Faber", "S, Tei", "R, Pascual-Marqui", "P, Milz", "K, Kochi"], "abstract": "Brain functional states are established by functional connectivities between brain regions.

This analysis removes ambiguities of localization, volume conduction-induced inflation of coherence, and reference-dependence. All significant differences (corrected for multiple testing) between meditation compared to no-task rest before and after meditation showed lower coherence during meditation, in all five traditions and eight (inhibitory as well as excitatory) frequency bands. Conventional coherence between the original head surface EEG time series very predominantly also showed reduced coherence during meditation. The topography of the functional connectivities was examined via PCA-based computation of principal connectivities. When going into and out of meditation, significantly different connectivities revealed clearly different topographies in the delta frequency band and minor differences in the beta-2 band. The globally reduced functional interdependence between brain regions in meditation suggests that interaction between the self process functions is minimized, and that constraints on the self process by other processes are minimized, thereby leading to the subjective experience of non-involvement, detachment and letting go, as well as of all-oneness and dissolution of ego borders during meditation."}, {"id": "2ecb7090f2beb9b001f5372ef94b7f4025af7754", "title": "Monitoring the neural activity of the state of mental silence while practicing Sahaja yoga meditation.", "citationCount": 29, "year": 2015, "size": 111.75675675675676, "color": "#bc3587", "shortName": "Hernandez2015-tt", "doi": "10.1089/acm.2013.0450", "authors": ["S, Hern\u00e1ndez", "Jos\u00e9, Suero", "K, Rubia", "J, Gonz\u00e1lez-Mora"], "abstract": "Objective: To identify the neural correlates of the state of mental silence as experienced through Sahaja yoga meditation.

Results: Relative to baseline, at the beginning of the meditation sessions there was a significant increase of activation in bilateral inferior frontal and temporal regions. Activation became progressively more reduced with deeper meditation stages and in the last meditation session it became localized to the right inferior frontal cortex/ right insula and right middle/superior temporal cortex. Furthermore, right inferior frontal activation was directly associated with the subjective depth of the mental silence experience. Conclusions: Meditators appear to pass through an initial intense neural self-control process necessary to silence their mind.

The increased focus on meditation in cognitive neuroscience has led to a cross-cultural classification of standard meditation styles validated by functional and structural neuroanatomical data. Meanwhile, the renaissance of psychedelic research has shed light on the neurophysiology of altered states of consciousness induced by classical psychedelics, such as psilocybin and LSD, whose effects are mainly mediated by agonism of serotonin receptors. Few attempts have been made at bridging these two domains of inquiry, despite intriguing evidence of overlap between the phenomenology and neurophysiology of meditation practice and psychedelic states. In particular, many contemplative traditions explicitly aim at dissolving the sense of self by eliciting altered states of consciousness through meditation, while classical psychedelics are known to produce significant disruptions of self-consciousness, a phenomenon known as drug-induced ego dissolution. In this article, we discuss available evidence regarding convergences and differences between phenomenological and neurophysiological data on meditation practice and psychedelic drug-induced states, with a particular emphasis on alterations of self-experience. While both meditation and psychedelics may disrupt self-consciousness and underlying neural processes, we emphasize that neither meditation nor psychedelic states can be conceived as simple, uniform categories. Moreover, we suggest that there are important phenomenological differences even between conscious states described as experiences of self-loss. As a result, we propose that self-consciousness may be best construed as a multidimensional construct, and that ``self-loss,'' far from being an unequivocal phenomenon, can take several forms. Indeed, various aspects of self-consciousness, including narrative aspects linked to autobiographical memory, self-related thoughts and mental time travel, and embodied aspects rooted in multisensory processes, may be differently affected by psychedelics and meditation practices. Finally, we consider long-term outcomes of experiences of self-loss induced by meditation and psychedelics on individual traits and prosocial behavior. We call for caution regarding the problematic conflation of temporary states of self-loss with ``selflessness'' as a behavioral or social trait, although there is preliminary evidence that correlations between short-term experiences of self-loss and long-term trait alterations may exist."}, {"id": "36ea4d25609255d71ae1d5649f77a93f05eaa118", "title": "Self-specific processing in the meditating brain: a MEG neurophenomenology study", "citationCount": 41, "year": 2016, "size": 116.62162162162161, "color": "#cc4778", "shortName": "Dor-Ziderman2016-pg", "doi": "10.1093/nc/niw019", "authors": ["Yair, Dor-Ziderman", "Y, Ataria", "S, Fulder", "A, Goldstein", "Aviva, Berkovich-Ohana"], "abstract": "Self-specific processes (SSPs) specify the self as an embodied subject and agent, implementing a functional self/nonself distinction in perception, cognition, and action.

We assemble evidence for this model and show how it can explain a broad range of phenomena associated with the psychedelic experience. With regard to their potential therapeutic use, we propose that psychedelics work to relax the precision weighting of pathologically overweighted priors underpinning various expressions of mental illness. We propose that this process entails an increased sensitization of high-level priors to bottom-up signaling (stemming from intrinsic sources), and that this heightened sensitivity enables the potential revision and deweighting of overweighted priors.

Two prominent, strongly competing networks exist in the human cortex: a dorsal attention network, that is activated during focused attention, and a default mode network, that is suppressed during attentionally demanding tasks. Prior studies suggest that strong anti-correlations between these networks indicate good brain health. In addition, a third network, a ventral attention network, serves as a ``circuit-breaker'' that transiently disrupts and redirects focused attention to permit salient stimuli to capture attention. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to contrast cortical network activation between experienced focused attention Vipassana meditators and matched controls. Participants performed two attention tasks during scanning: a sustained attention task and an attention-capture task. Meditators demonstrated increased magnitude of differential activation in the dorsal attention vs. default mode network in a sustained attention task, relative to controls. In contrast, there were no evident attention network differences between meditators and controls in an attentional reorienting paradigm. A resting state functional connectivity analysis revealed a greater magnitude of anticorrelation between dorsal attention and default mode networks in the meditators as compared to both our local control group and a n = 168 Human Connectome Project dataset. These results demonstrate, with both task- and rest-based fMRI data, increased stability in sustained attention processes without an associated attentional capture cost in meditators. Task and resting-state results, which revealed stronger anticorrelations between dorsal attention and default mode networks in experienced mediators than in controls, are consistent with a brain health benefit of long-term meditation practice."}, {"id": "8714f93a383ae40c41eb63669a5bd84a3c5a04a1", "title": "Identification of Visual Attentional Regions of the Temporoparietal Junction in Individual Subjects using a Vivid, Novel Oddball Paradigm", "citationCount": 5, "year": 2019, "size": 102.02702702702703, "color": "#f0804e", "shortName": "Devaney2019-lz", "doi": "10.3389/fnhum.2019.00424", "authors": ["Kathryn, Devaney", "M, Rosen", "Emily, Levin", "D, Somers"], "abstract": "The Temporoparietal Junction (TPJ) of the cerebral cortex is a functionally heterogeneous region that also exhibits substantial anatomical variability across individuals.

This paradigm employs novel oddball images with a strong visual drive to produce robust TPJ responses in individuals. Vivid, novel oddballs drive responses in two TPJ regions bilaterally, a posterior region centered in posterior Superior Temporal Sulcus (TPJSTS) and an anterior region in ventral Supramarginal Gyrus (TPJSMG). Although an attentional reorienting task fails to drive TPJ activation in individuals, group analysis of the attentional reorienting contrast reveals recruitment of right TPJSTS, but not right TPJSMG. Similarly, right TPJSTS, as identified in individual subjects by the vivid, novel oddball contrast, is activated by attentional reorienting, but right TPJSMG is not.

Specifically, we trained a classifier to predict the meditation style in two groups of subjects: expert Theravada Buddhist monks and novice meditators. We showed that the classifier was able to discriminate the meditation style only in the expert group. Additionally, by inspecting the trained classifier, we observed that the Anterior Salience and the Default Mode networks were relevant for the classification, in line with their theorized involvement in emotion and self-related regulation in meditation.
