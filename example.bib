               concentrative absorption meditative (ACAM) states brought about
               by meditation. While previously cultivated mostly in monastic
               settings, a series of modern meditation manuals both openly
               discuss the jhānas and describe how they may be attained by
               laypeople. Simultaneously, the phenomenological and
               neuroscientific investigation of the jhānas is advancing.
               Although the descriptions of the jhānas in contemporary jhāna
               manuals to some degree overlap with one another, there are also
               significant disagreements. Here our objectives are to identify
               common features of jhāna in meditation manuals, to identify and
               discuss disagreements, and to offer an account of jhāna that is
               both comprehensive and consistent. Methods A literature search
               and review was conducted. The search resulted in eight meditation
               manuals that provide phenomenologically rich accounts of the full
               range of the jhānas. Common characteristics and discrepancies in
               the different accounts of the jhānas have been identified by
               comparing terms and descriptions. Results We offer a general
               definition of jhāna, distinguish three types of jhāna, and
               investigate phenomenological dimensions that may be necessary to
               address in order to comprehensively articulate the experience of
               ACAM. Conclusions To ensure scientific rigor, the study of jhāna
               needs to be informed by both commonalities and differences in the
               existing accounts of jhāna. While differences exist, these may
               also be systematically unified in a way that yields a
               comprehensive account of ACAM.",

               psychological qualities including joy, peace, compassion, and
               attentional stability. Mapping the neurobiological substrates of
               jhana meditation can inform the development and application of
               advanced meditation to enhance well-being. Only two prior studies
               have attempted to investigate the neural correlates of jhana
               meditation, and the rarity of adept practitioners has largely
               restricted the size and extent of these studies. Therefore,
               examining the consistency and reliability of observed brain
               responses associated with jhana meditation can be valuable. In
               this study, we aimed to characterize functional magnetic
               resonance imaging (fMRI) reliability within a single subject over
               repeated runs in canonical brain networks during jhana meditation
               performed by an adept practitioner over 5 days (27 fMRI runs)
               inside an ultra-high field 7 Tesla MRI scanner. We found that
               thalamus and several cortical networks, that is, the somatomotor,

               attention, salience) showed noticeable increases in reliability
               when fMRI measurements were adjusted for variability in
               self-reported phenomenology related to jhana meditation. Overall,

               replicate networks of functionally coupled regions across the

               sensory and motor cortices as well as distributed networks of

              meditative tasks. The tasks comprised a wakeful “thoughtless
              emptiness (TE),” a “focused attention,” and an “open monitoring”
              task asking for mindful presence in the moment and in the
              environment without attachment to distracting thoughts. Our
              analysis mainly focused on 30 highly experienced meditators with
              at least 5 years and 1000 h of meditation experience. Spectral EEG
              power comparisons of the TE state with the resting state or other
              forms of meditation showed decreased activities in specific
              frequency bands. In contrast to a focused attention task the TE
              task showed significant central and parietal gamma decreases (p <
              0.05). Compared to open monitoring TE expressed decreased alpha
              and beta amplitudes, mainly in parietal areas (p < 0.01). TE
              presented significantly less delta (p < 0.001) and theta (p <

              characterized by reduced high-frequency brain processing with
              simultaneous reduction of the low frequencies. This suggests that
              such a state of meditative conscious awareness might be different

              challenging and potentially harmful. Initial research suggests
              that complex interactions and temporal sequences may explain these

              (SCR) than the relaxation control. Differences in heart rate
              variability (HRV) and EEG power suggested greater involvement of
              the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in the IBMT group during and

              discourse about meditation is the plethora of semantic constructs
              and the lack of a unified definition and taxonomy. In recent years
              there have been several notable attempts to formulate new lexicons
              in order to define and categorize meditation methods. While these
              constructs have been useful and have encountered varying degrees
              of acceptance, they have also been subject to misinterpretation
              and debate, leaving the field devoid of a consensual paradigm.
              This paper attempts to influence this ongoing discussion by
              proposing two new models which hold the potential for enhanced
              scientific reliability and acceptance. Regarding the quest for a
              universally acceptable taxonomy, we suggest a paradigm shift away
              from the norm of fabricatIng new terminology from a first-person
              perspective. As an alternative, we propose a new taxonomic system
              based on the historically well-established and commonly accepted
              third-person paradigm of Affect and Cognition, borrowed, in part,
              from the psychological and cognitive sciences. With regard to the
              elusive definitional problem, we propose a model of meditation
              which clearly distinguishes “method” from “state” and is
              conceptualized as a dynamic process which is inclusive of six
              related but distinct stages. The overall goal is to provide
              researchers with a reliable nomenclature with which to categorize
              and classify diverse meditation methods, and a conceptual
              framework which can provide direction for their research and a

              experiences that are internal and self-related. The cerebral
              cortex appears to be divided into two corresponding systems: an
              “extrinsic” system composed of brain areas that respond more to
              external stimuli and tasks and an “intrinsic” system composed of
              brain areas that respond less to external stimuli and tasks. These
              two broad brain systems seem to compete with each other, such that
              their activity levels over time is usually anti-correlated, even
              when subjects are “at rest” and not performing any task. This
              study used meditation as an experimental manipulation to test
              whether this competition (anti-correlation) can be modulated by
              cognitive strategy. Participants either fixated without meditation
              (fixation), or engaged in non-dual awareness (NDA) or focused

              correlation between areas within each system did not change across

              property of brain organization and that practicing different forms

              cross-cultural classification of standard meditation styles
              validated by functional and structural neuroanatomical data.
              Meanwhile, the renaissance of psychedelic research has shed light
              on the neurophysiology of altered states of consciousness induced
              by classical psychedelics, such as psilocybin and LSD, whose
              effects are mainly mediated by agonism of serotonin receptors. Few
              attempts have been made at bridging these two domains of inquiry,
              despite intriguing evidence of overlap between the phenomenology
              and neurophysiology of meditation practice and psychedelic states.
              In particular, many contemplative traditions explicitly aim at
              dissolving the sense of self by eliciting altered states of
              consciousness through meditation, while classical psychedelics are
              known to produce significant disruptions of self-consciousness, a
              phenomenon known as drug-induced ego dissolution. In this article,
              we discuss available evidence regarding convergences and
              differences between phenomenological and neurophysiological data
              on meditation practice and psychedelic drug-induced states, with a
              particular emphasis on alterations of self-experience. While both
              meditation and psychedelics may disrupt self-consciousness and
              underlying neural processes, we emphasize that neither meditation
              nor psychedelic states can be conceived as simple, uniform
              categories. Moreover, we suggest that there are important
              phenomenological differences even between conscious states
              described as experiences of self-loss. As a result, we propose
              that self-consciousness may be best construed as a
              multidimensional construct, and that ``self-loss,'' far from being
              an unequivocal phenomenon, can take several forms. Indeed, various
              aspects of self-consciousness, including narrative aspects linked
              to autobiographical memory, self-related thoughts and mental time
              travel, and embodied aspects rooted in multisensory processes, may
              be differently affected by psychedelics and meditation practices.
              Finally, we consider long-term outcomes of experiences of
              self-loss induced by meditation and psychedelics on individual
              traits and prosocial behavior. We call for caution regarding the
              problematic conflation of temporary states of self-loss with
              ``selflessness'' as a behavioral or social trait, although there
              is preliminary evidence that correlations between short-term
              experiences of self-loss and long-term trait alterations may
              exist.",

              to relax the precision of high-level priors or beliefs, thereby
              liberating bottom-up information flow, particularly via intrinsic

              precise functional organization of TPJ remains controversial. One
              or more regions within TPJ support visual attention processes, but
              the “attention TPJ” is difficult to functionally observe in

              bases of this improvement are unknown. Two prominent, strongly
              competing networks exist in the human cortex: a dorsal attention
              network, that is activated during focused attention, and a default
              mode network, that is suppressed during attentionally demanding
              tasks. Prior studies suggest that strong anti-correlations between
              these networks indicate good brain health. In addition, a third
              network, a ventral attention network, serves as a
              ``circuit-breaker'' that transiently disrupts and redirects
              focused attention to permit salient stimuli to capture attention.
              Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to contrast
              cortical network activation between experienced focused attention
              Vipassana meditators and matched controls. Participants performed
              two attention tasks during scanning: a sustained attention task

              default mode network in a sustained attention task, relative to

  abstract  = "Absence of consciousness can occur due to a concussion,
               anesthetization, intoxication, epileptic seizure, or other
               fainting/syncope episode caused by lack of blood flow to the
               brain. However, some meditation practitioners also report that it
               is possible to undergo a total absence of consciousness during
               meditation, lasting up to 7 days, and that these “cessations” can
               be consistently induced. One form of extended cessation (i.e.,
               nirodha samāpatti) is thought to be different from sleep because
               practitioners are said to be completely impervious to external
               stimulation. That is, they cannot be 'woken up' from the
               cessation state as one might be from a dream. Cessations are also
               associated with the absence of any time experience or tiredness,
               and are said to involve a stiff rather than a relaxed body.
               Emergence from meditation-induced cessations is said to have
               profound effects on subsequent cognition and experience (e.g.,
               resulting in a sudden sense of clarity, openness, and possibly
               insights). In this paper, we briefly outline the historical
               context for cessation events, present preliminary data from two
               labs, set a research agenda for their study, and provide an
               initial framework for understanding what meditation induced
               cessation may reveal about the mind and brain. We conclude by
               integrating these so-called nirodha and nirodha samāpatti
               experiences—as they are known in classical Buddhism—into current
               cognitive-neurocomputational and active inference frameworks of
               meditation.",
